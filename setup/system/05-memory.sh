# RAM Management Optimization
# Fixes Linux's aggressive caching behavior that consumes all available RAM

# Prevents system from caching everything and struggling to free memory when needed

# Reduce VFS cache pressure - be less aggressive about caching file system metadata
# Default is 100, setting to 50 makes kernel less likely to reclaim directory/inode caches

# Reduce swappiness - prefer to use RAM before swapping to disk
# Default is 60, setting to 10 makes system much less likely to swap

# Prevents large write bursts that can cause system lag
